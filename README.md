Project Overview

The Android Calculator App is a lightweight mobile application developed using Java in Android Studio. It performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) while providing a simple, user-friendly interface. The app serves as both a functional tool and an educational resource for understanding Android development.

Current Features

Input two numbers using EditText fields

Perform operations via dedicated buttons: ‚ûï ‚ûñ ‚úñÔ∏è ‚ûó

Display result in a TextView

Handles divide-by-zero errors gracefully

Clears input fields and resets output with a Clear button

Simple LinearLayout XML design with responsive spacing

Week 4 Update (Changes Since Week 3)

Added Clear button functionality to reset inputs and results.

Improved input validation with Toast messages for empty fields or invalid numbers.

Restructured the layout for better spacing and usability.
